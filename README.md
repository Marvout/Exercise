# Exercise
Projects for exercising

My current project is a program which shall track my travels from my home to work. For that
I need an UI which should ask for the needed information. In addition to that I implementet some favorites. They shall save time since
my home and the work destination barely changes very often.
Also I use a database from Microsoft Access. My goal for now is, to achieve a working program which helps me
to edit the database. Then I could use this database and print the travels in Microsoft Excel. My final goal would be
to do everthing with the c# program, so also the printing in a specific way and layout.

I have been using c# for a couple of months now. Before I started to learn C# i got some experience with VBA (2years).
